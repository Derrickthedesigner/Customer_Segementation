# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ANALYSIS.

This repository presents a comprehensive workflow for customer segmentation using **unsupervised learning**, with a strong emphasis on **clustering techniques**. 
The project is structured around 40 guided questions that span exploratory analysis, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and clustering evaluation.

## Dataset Overview

Thera are 2 datasets used for this analysis:


## Project Focus

The core objective is to apply **unsupervised learning** to uncover hidden patterns and segment customers into meaningful groups. The project emphasizes:

- **Clustering algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Dimensionality reduction**: PCA and t-SNE 
- **Evaluation metrics**: Elbow method, silhouette scores, dendrogram analysis
- **Cluster profiling**: Behavioral and demographic insights per segment

## Assignment Breakdown

### Part A — Exploratory Data Analysis (Q1–8)
- Load and inspect dataset
- Identify missing/unrealistic values
- Bin age and analyze categorical distributions

### Part B — Data Cleaning & Feature Creation (Q9–15)
- Handle missing values and duplicates.
- Create new categorical features.
- Apply feature scaling and quantile bucketing.

### Part C — Aggregation & Feature Engineering (Q16–22)
- Group-based statistics and new ratio features
- Flag high-value customers based on income and spending
- Correlation analysis and pivot tables

### Part D — Visualizations (Q23–27)
- Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, boxplots
- Heatmaps for numeric feature relationships

### Part E — Dimensionality Reduction (Q28–31)
- PCA for variance analysis and component visualization
- t-SNE for nonlinear embedding and cluster discovery
- Comparative analysis of PCA vs t-SNE

### Part F — Clustering & Evaluation (Q32–40)
- K-Means clustering with elbow and silhouette methods
- Hierarchical clustering with dendrograms
- Cluster profiling, size checks, and stability testing
- Export final dataset with cluster labels


## Key Lessons Learnt
- Identified optimal number of clusters.
- Visualized customer segments in reduced dimensions
- Profiled clusters for strategic insights.
- Exported labeled dataset for later use.
